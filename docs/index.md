# solstice-calendar

Headless, framework-agnostic calendar and date-time core.

## Who this is for

This documentation is for engineers who want full UI control while relying on a deterministic date-time core.

## What you get

- Strict timezone-free value model
- Controlled or uncontrolled state patterns
- Constraint and disabled-rule composition
- Headless prop getters for calendar and inputs
- Predictable keyboard and input behavior

## Edge cases

- Controlled mode requires callback reinjection
- Invalid input drafts are temporary until blur
- Calendar grid includes adjacent-month dates
