# solstice-calendar

Headless, framework-agnostic calendar and date-time core.

## When should I use this?

Use this page when you want to choose the best starting point for your integration.

Use this documentation as a guided path:

1. Start with [Start Here](/start-here/)
2. Build your first implementation in [Build Your First Picker](/first-picker/)
3. Learn expected behavior in [Core Concepts](/core-concepts/value-model)
4. Solve integration details in [Guides](/guides/navigation-focus)
5. Reuse complete setups in [Recipes](/recipes/date-only-picker)
6. Use [API Reference](/api/) as lookup

## Who this is for

This documentation is for engineers who want full UI control while relying on a deterministic date-time core.

## What you get

- Strict timezone-free value model
- Controlled or uncontrolled state patterns
- Constraint and disabled-rule composition
- Headless prop getters for calendar and inputs
- Predictable keyboard and input behavior

## Edge cases

- Controlled mode requires callback reinjection
- Invalid input drafts are temporary until blur
- Calendar grid includes adjacent-month dates
