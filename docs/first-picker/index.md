# Build Your First Picker

## When should I use this?

Use this section if you want a practical implementation path from zero to a usable picker.

## Learning path

1. [Minimal Date Picker](/first-picker/minimal-date-picker)
2. [Add Time Selection](/first-picker/add-time-selection)
3. [Render Calendar Grid](/first-picker/render-calendar-grid)
4. [Wire Inputs](/first-picker/wire-inputs)

## Edge cases covered in this section

- Date selection with no existing value
- Disabled days and times
- Invalid input drafts and blur behavior

## Next step

Start with [Minimal Date Picker](/first-picker/minimal-date-picker).
