# Guide

## When should I use this?

Use this page only if you arrived from an old link.

This route is kept for compatibility.

Use the new documentation flow:

1. [Start Here](/start-here/)
2. [Build Your First Picker](/first-picker/)
3. [Core Concepts](/core-concepts/value-model)
4. [Guides](/guides/navigation-focus)
5. [Recipes](/recipes/date-only-picker)
6. [API Reference](/api/)

## Edge cases

- Legacy links may still point to this page
- The authoritative flow now starts in Start Here

## Next step

Go to [Start Here](/start-here/).
